SuperTateti (Super TicTacToe)
Welcome! This is a small personal project called "Super Tateti" or "Super TicTacToe."

Game Rules:
    -You can choose who starts, or the game can begin with "X" starting by default.
    -On the first turn, you can mark any cell on any board.
    -After the first turn, you must place your mark on the board that corresponds to the cell your opponent selected in the previous turn.
    -When you win a board, that board becomes yours.
    -To win the overall game, you must win 3 boards in a row, column, or diagonal (just like in traditional TicTacToe).
    -If your opponent marks a cell on a board that has already been won, you are free to place your mark on any board you choose.
