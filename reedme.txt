Hello, this is a small personal project.
This is a game called "megaTateti" or "megaTicTacToe".

These are the rules:
- always starts the X
- In the first turn you can mark wherever you want
- after you have to mark on the board that corresponds to the box your opponent marked
- when you win a board, that boardis yours
- to win the game you have to mark 3 bourd in row, column or diagonal (like normal TicTacToe)
- if your opponent mark in a box and that board is already won, you can marj wherever you want

for a more detailed rules you have this document:
